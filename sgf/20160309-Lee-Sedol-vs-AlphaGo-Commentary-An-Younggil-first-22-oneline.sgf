If Black doesn't exchange 1 for 2 first, White can play at C to press Black down.\n\nIf White still peeps at C (after the exchange of 1 for 2) Black will push and cut with D to F. Instead of D, playing the tesuji at F immediately is also possible.]\n))\n(;W[pg];B[oe];W[ne];B[of]\n(;W[qc];B[qf];W[rd];B[nd];W[oc];B[re];W[pd];B[qe];W[md];B[le]LB[oc:9][qc:5][ld:A][md:13][nd:8][pd:11][rd:7][le:14][ne:3][oe:2][qe:12][re:10][of:4][qf:6][pg:1][ql:B]\nC[After Black's pincer at A, White 1 starts a joseki.\n\nHowever, the result up to Black 14 looks well balanced for Black, because B becomes an excellent move which develops the right side.]\n)\n(;W[pd];B[qf];W[qc];B[qe];W[nf];B[og];W[pb];B[id]LB[pb:11][qc:7][id:12][pd:5][ne:3][oe:2][qe:8][nf:9][of:4][qf:6][og:10][pg:1][ql:A][pq:B]\nC[White 5 is an older joseki, but Black develops efficient formations at the top and on the right side with Black 2 to 12.\n\nAs you can see, A strikes a good balance with Black's position in the top right, as well as his stone at B.]\n)))\n\n
